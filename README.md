## Understanding the Minnesota Data Practices Act

Do keep in mind that no person writing this is a lawyer or has a law degree.  These are experiences and knowledge from the perspective of journalism.

Overall, the law states that records are open unless otherwise specified in the law.  Do keep in mind that there are 100's of exceptions in the law.  So, in general the burden is on the government or agency to show why information can be legally withheld.

### Noteable parts

* Under the [13.025](https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/statutes/?id=13.025) Subdivision 01, authorities must maintain a data inventory which should detail data collected, even the private and confidential parts.
* Under the [13.03](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=13.03) Subdivision 03, data can be requested for inspection which should no incure a charge.  Overall, inspection seems to apply for visual inspection of the data, and for data that is available remotely in a digital format.  Overall, it is unclear what "inspection" really means in regards to the difference of a non-"inspection" request, at least in an electronic format.
* Under [13.06](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=13.06), goverments and agencies can put "temporary classification" on data that can make it inaccessbile to the public for up to 45 days.
* The DPA does not apply to:
    * State Legislature (see [IPAD presentation](http://www.ipad.state.mn.us/docs/Can%20I%20ask%20for%20that.pdf) (law link needed)
    * Certain Townships (see [IPAD presentation](http://www.ipad.state.mn.us/docs/Can%20I%20ask%20for%20that.pdf) (link needed)
