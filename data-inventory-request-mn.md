To the Data Practices Responsible Authority at [[AGENCY NAME]]:

Under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, Minn. Stat. ยง 13.01, et seq., I am requesting your agency's data inventory (as defined pursuant to Minn. Stat. ยง 13.025, subd. 1) for the following:

All data collected by [[AGENCY NAME]] and any departments under [[AGENCY NAME]]   
OR [[A SPECIFIC DATABASE OR DATASET]]  

I would like to inspect the most recent, complete copy of the data inventory(s).  If the inventory is stored in electronic form, I would like to inspect the copy in an electronic format for inspection either via email or download using my own equipment as permitted by Minn. Stat. ยง 13.03, subd. 3(b).

As a data inventory is required by law to maintain, there should be no additional costs or resources to compile the data inventory.  I authorize no costs at this time, but if necessary, please inform me of any fees or costs associated with this request with specifics as to the reason of these fees and costs. Note that this information is not being sought for commercial purposes.

[[Pursuant to Minn. Stat. ยง 13.03, subd. 2(b), I am a researcher and would greatly appreciate "full convenience and comprehensive accessibility."]]

I would request a prompt response to this request.  If you expect a significant delay in responding to or in fulfilling this request, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies.

If this data cannot be provided in an electronic format, please cite specific statutory and technical reasons.  If this data cannot be provided in a format other than PDF, please site specific technical reasons.

If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific statutory exemption or temporary classification that justifies a refusal to release each specific component of the data, and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
